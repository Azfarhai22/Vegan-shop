# Vegan-shop
In this project I have built a Static web page called Vegan Store. I used html, Css, AZURE STATIC WEB APP  and AZURE STORAGE ACCOUNTS.
In this website you can see our different shops and main benifits of being a vegan and also anyone can contact us from contact page.
They can also subscribe for our newsletters.I used AZURE STATIC WEB APP to host and STORAGE ACCOUNTS to store the source code.
